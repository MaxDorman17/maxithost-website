                <p>The specific features included depend on your chosen plan. We reserve the right to modify our service offerings with reasonable notice.</p>

                <h2>Client Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>As a client, you are responsible for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing accurate contact and billing information</li>
                    <li>Supplying website content and files in a usable format</li>
                    <li>Ensuring you have the rights to any content you provide</li>

                    <li>Notifying us promptly of any issues or concerns</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Uptime and Availability</h2>
                <p>We make reasonable efforts to maintain high availability for all hosted websites. Our infrastructure is monitored continuously and we respond to issues as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>However, we do not guarantee 100% uptime. Occasional downtime may occur due to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scheduled maintenance (we aim to provide advance notice)</li>
                    <li>Emergency security updates</li>
                    <li>Issues with third-party providers (DNS, upstream networks)</li>
                    <li>Circumstances beyond our reasonable control</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Support and Response Times</h2>
                <p>Support is provided via email during UK business hours (typically Monday to Friday, 9am to 6pm). We aim to respond to most enquiries within the same business day.</p>
                <p>Emergency support outside of business hours may be available for critical issues affecting site availability. Out-of-hours work may be charged at an additional rate, which will be communicated before any chargeable work is undertaken.</p>

                <h2>Payments and Billing</h2>
                <p>Hosting plans are billed monthly in advance. Payment is due upon receipt of invoice or as agreed at sign-up.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Card payments are processed securely via Stripe</li>
                    <li>Additional work outside your plan may be invoiced separately</li>
                    <li>Prices may be adjusted with 30 days' notice</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If payment is not received, we will attempt to contact you. Continued non-payment may result in suspension of services after reasonable notice. We will always try to resolve payment issues before taking action.</p>

                <h2>Cancellations and Termination</h2>
                <p>You may cancel your hosting at any time by contacting us via email. We require 30 days' notice for cancellation.</p>

                    <li>We may retain basic records for accounting and legal purposes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We reserve the right to terminate services immediately in cases of serious breach of these terms, including non-payment or acceptable use violations.</p>

                <h2>Backups</h2>
                <p>We perform automated backups of hosted websites as part of our standard service. However:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Restoration from backup may not always be possible</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you need specific backup or recovery assistance, please contact us to discuss your requirements.</p>
